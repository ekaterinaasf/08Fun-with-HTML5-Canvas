# 08 Fun-with-HTML5-Canvas: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> - We need to create 3 files for the site itself: for DOM, for styles and for script.
> - We need to create 2 other files describing the project: Readme.md and development-strategy.md.

## 1. User Story: Create index.html

> - We need a canvas to demonstrate the changes
> - We need blocks describing as `<canvas>` elements inside the `<body>``
> - We need to create a separate branch `index` for index.html

## 2. User Story: Create styles.css

> - We need to create separate styles for html. body and set up appropriate margins.
> - We need to create a separate branch `style` for style.css

## 3. User Story: Create script.js

> - We need to create listeners for 4 actions with the mouse.
> - We need to create a separate branch `script` for script.js

## 4. User Story: Create Readme.md

> - We need to create readme.md describing the structure of all files inside this project.

## 5. User Story: Create development-strategy.md

> - We need to create development-strategy.md describing the set of user stories in which we divided an entire project.
> - Put development-strategy.md inside the branch `master`, to be in comply with the Occam's razor principe.
